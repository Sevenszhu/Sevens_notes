# Experiment of Au-assisted Mechanical Exfoliation of large-area 2D crystals

## 1 Experimental subject

$WSe_2$ can be used.

 ($BN$ (1.07), $GeS_2$ (1.17), and *graphene* (1.24) **can't** be used because their $R_{LA/IL}$ is lower than 1.3, which is a **critical point** allowing the **considerable yield** of exfoliation)

And I can't find the result of $R_{LA/IL}$ of $WS_2$ , while I don't know how to calculate it by myself.

## 2 Environment

It can be done in **a glove box** without exposure to air, the whole process lasts 1–2 min. It can **also** be carried out in **a clean room**, while the **temperature and humidity** always keep at 25 °C and 45%

## 3 Method

### 3.1 Substrate $Si$

1. **Evaporate** an **adhesion metal layer($Ti$ or $Cr$)** and **$Au$ film** respectively on the $Si$ substrate(with 300 nm $SiO_2$ film).  (The machine in our lab **can only evaporate $Au$, $Ag$, $Al$ and some inorganic compound** whereas the recommended machine model is Peva-600E. And through the article, Al is of high activity to 2D layers.)
2. The **evaporation rate** should bedd  The **optimal thickness** of $Au/Ti$ is 2 nm/ 2 nm.

### 3.2 2D Crystal material

- The **thickness of the bulk crystal** should be **smaller** than 1mm, nevertheless it **can't be too tiny(monolayer or few layer)**. 
- the tape can be white tape (3 M scotch) or blue tape (Nitto), depending on your preference.
    1.  **Cleave** the tape 2–3 times from pristine bulk crystal.

### 3.3 Operation

1. **Put** the tape onto substrate with metal film.
2. **Press** the tape **vertically** for about **1 min**, the tape can be **removed** from substrate.

ps. There is **unavoidably some glue residues on the substrate**, to **prevent** it, we can use **home-made polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)** to **replace** these **tapes** as **transfer media**.

### 3.4 Remove the gold film

1. **Spin-coat** the PMMA onto the monolayer;
2. **Put** the sample into the $KI/I_2$ solution for 10 hours when the **gold film** was **removed** and the **PMMA film together with the flake** was **detached** from the $SiO_2/Si$ substrate.
